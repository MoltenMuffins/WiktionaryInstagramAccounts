# Wiktionary Instagram Accounts

A simple scraping project to identify available usernames on Instagram, using [*english Wiktionary*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page) as a resource of usernames.

If you want to, you could replace the Wiktionary Dump file with your own reference material as a resource of usernames to look up.
